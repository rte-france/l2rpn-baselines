## Algorithm implementation
<!--Provide us with the code where your model is implemented-->

Ex: https://github.com/blablabla/myawesomemodel.git

Check your model follows the template code for l2rpn-baselines:

- [ ] it is freely available on github / gitlab
- [ ] it exports a function call exactly `evaluate` 
- [ ] it exports a class named like your github / gitlab (for example, if it is    
  hosted at https://github.com/YourName/MyAwesomeModel) then you need to be able to do something like `from MyAwesomeModel import MyAwesomeModel`). Once 
  included into l2rpn-baselines, it will be imported with `from l2rpn_baselines.MyAwesomeModel import MyAwesomeModel`

## License
