class GymEnvWithHeuristics(GymEnv):
    """This abstract class is used to perform some actions, independantly of a RL
    agent on a grid2op environment.
    
    It can be used, for example, to train an agent (for example a deep-rl agent)
    if you want to use some heuristics at inference time (for example
    you reconnect every powerline that you can.)
    
    The heuristic you want to implement should be implemented in :func:`GymEnvWithHeuristics.heuristic_actions`.
    
    Examples
    --------
    Let's imagine, for example, that you want to implement an RL agent that performs actions on the grid. But you noticed
    that your agent performs better if the all the powerlines are reconnected (which is often the case by the way).
    
    To that end, you want to force the reconnection of powerline each time it's possible. When it's not possible, you want to
    let the neural network do what is best for the environment.
    
    Training an agent on such setting might be difficult and require recoding some (deep) part of the training framework (*eg*
    stable-baselines). Unless... You use a dedicated "environment".
    
    In this environment (compatible, inheriting the base class `gym.Env`) will handle all the "heuristic" part and only show
    the agent with the state where it should act.
    
    Basically a "step" happens like this:
    
    #. the agent issue an action (gym format)
    #. the action (gym format) is decoded to a grid2op compatible action (thanks to the action_space)
    #. this grid2op action is implemented on the grid (thanks to the underlying grid2op environment)
       and the corresponding grid2op observation is generated
    #. this observation is processed by the  :func:`GymEnvWithHeuristics.apply_heuristics_actions`: the grid2op_env.step
       is called until the NN agent is require to take a decision (or the flag `done=True` is set).
    #. the observation (corresponding to the last step above) is then converted to a gym action (thanks to the observation_space)
       which is forwarded to the agent.
    
    The agent then only "sees" what is not processed by the heuristic. It is trained only on the relevant "state".
